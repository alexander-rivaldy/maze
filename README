DISCLAIMER
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code in main.cpp, arg_processor.cpp, arg_processor.h, 
action.cpp and action.h is not entirely ours.
We implemented the working sample code given by Paul Miller 
after the assignment 1 marking to our code after some adjustment

Inside the file DijsktraSolver.cpp , we have commented the
failed implementation of binary heap. We tried to complete it
before submission, but we couldn't figure out how to do it on time,
therefore we used our backup plan and commented the binary heap.
We hope it can still be taken into consideration.

We used factory pattern, which can be clearly seen in the solve_action
where we created the corresponding class according to which 
algorithm that the user chooses. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the same folder as main.cpp and Makefile, and type & enter make.
To be able to run valgrind and gdb, type & enter make debug

To run the solving algorithm with --pb --pd --pm or --pe , those args
will need to be followed by a svg name file.

KNOWN BUGS 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The DFS solver can't detect an unsolvable maze
